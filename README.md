# Donation Tracker

DoT (Donation Tracker) is a web application using IBM blockchain platform and hyperledger fabric, aiming to provide our broad users (the public from all over the world) a chance to donate for their life and the life of their local societies. Users can donate or store necessary goods and materials for surviving disasters and post-disaster reconstruction, before future possible disasters happen. They can also retrieve what they need after disasters based on our calculation and records of users past contribution status. Usersâ€™ contribution history or records are transparent to other users, encouraging the society to donate together wisely and properly.

We use two tools to develop our project. The first tool we used is hyperledger composer, but we found that it's not under maintenance. So we tried the second tool which is hyperledger fabric and IBM blockchain platform. Basically, we built our web app based on IBM evote case, and adapted it to our project.
